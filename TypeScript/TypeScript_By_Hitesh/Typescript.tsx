//TypeScript is not about reinventing the javascript.
// Dont use typescript, unless you are using it for a specific purpose.

//
// What typescript does:
// 1. Typescript check the code as we type it, and it will give us a warning if we are doing something wrong. It
// 2. Type checking: TypeScript checks your code for type errors at compile time, which can help catch bugs early in the development process.
// 3. It's a development tool. Your project still runs on JavaScript. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which means that any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. TypeScript adds optional static typing to JavaScript, which can help catch errors at compile time rather than runtime. This can lead to more robust and maintainable code, especially in larger projects.
